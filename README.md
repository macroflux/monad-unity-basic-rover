# Robot Simulation in Unity

This project is a Unity simulation of a basic differential drive robot navigating a randomly generated terrain. The simulation includes physics-based movement, stability control, terrain generation, and boundary walls to prevent the robot from leaving the simulation area. The robot can be controlled using keyboard inputs, and it displays real-time information such as position, speed, pitch, yaw, and roll.

## Features

- **Differential Drive Robot Simulation**: Simulate a robot with forward/backward movement and rotation using keyboard inputs.
- **Physics-Based Interaction**: The robot interacts with the terrain and obstacles realistically, including collision detection and gravity.
- **Stability Control**: Monitors the robot's pitch, yaw, and roll to prevent flipping and handle flips when they occur.
- **Random Terrain Generation**: Generates a new, gently rolling terrain each time the simulation starts.
- **Automatic Robot Positioning**: Ensures the robot starts above the terrain surface to prevent falling through.
- **Boundary Walls**: Adds walls around the terrain to prevent the robot from leaving the simulation area.
- **Real-Time Debug Display**: Shows the robot's position, speed, pitch, yaw, and roll on the screen during the simulation.
